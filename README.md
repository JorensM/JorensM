# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jorens

Hi! My name is Jorens, I'm from Latvia and I'm a coder/writer/musician/artist.

I'm currently working on my top secret freelance projects, as well as some personal open-source
projects:
 * [react-tab-state](https://github.com/Printy-Studios/react-tab-state) - a React library that allows you to sync state across tabs
 * [react-context-menu](https://github.com/Printy-Studios/react-context-menu) - a React library that simplifies the creation of right-click context menus
 * [daily-planner](https://github.com/Printy-Studios/daily-planner) - a web app that helps you track your tasks
